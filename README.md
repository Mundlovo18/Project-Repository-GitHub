## Project Title
BikeShare System

## Description
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day. This aims to estimulate users to choose bikes from cars thus reducing C02 pollution.
